Why is NumPy’s array slicing faster than Python’s list slicing?**"],"metadata":{"id":"cD36EjqMqqqF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**ANS**\n","\n","NumPy's array slicing is generally faster than Python's list slicing due to how NumPy arrays are stored and processed:\n","\n","- **Contiguous Memory Allocation**: NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory. This allows for efficient access and manipulation of elements, including slicing, as the system can quickly locate the required data. Python lists, on the other hand, store references to objects that can be scattered throughout memory, making slicing potentially less efficient.\n","\n","- **Optimized Implementation**: NumPy's slicing operations are implemented in highly optimized C code. This lower-level implementation takes advantage of the contiguous memory layout to perform slicing much faster than Python's list slicing, which is handled at a higher level.\n","\n","- **Homogeneous Data Type**: Because NumPy arrays are homogeneous (all elements are the same data type), NumPy knows the size of each element and can calculate memory addresses directly, further speeding up slicing. Python lists, being heterogeneous, require more overhead to handle elements of different types."],"metadata":{"id":"cPq-Wcz1q5HR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q 22.
